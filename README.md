# Usage #

Many examples in this project can be used in connection with FEKO, a commercial software package
that forms part of the HyperWorks suite. In some cases, a valid license file is therefore required
to run certain parts of the solver (e.g. running *.pre or *.cfx files directly from the utility.) 
It is possible to parse already existing *.pre, *.out, *.fek and *.bof files without the requirement 
to have a valid FEKO license. Currently, there is no GUI (i.e. this is a CLI version) and is written 
in Octave (can also be simulated using MATLAB). For a more detailed discussion on the software, please 
review the documentation / manuals added in the /doc folder.
